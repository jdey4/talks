### Outline

- Motivation
- [Estimating Batch Effects](#statistics)
- [Removing Batch Effects](#remove)
- [Real Data](#results)
- [Discussion](#disc)

---

### Modern neuroimaging data 

- Neuroimaging data is big and costly
- Expansive mega-studies collected globally
- Unprecedented sample diversity (demographically) and sizes 
  <!-- - generalizability -->

--



---

### Sources of variability are not well understood

- Batch Effect: the impact of the data collection procedure (measurement device, measurement protocol, season, etc.) on the data collected

- Demographic Effects: impact on the data of scientifically "interesting" characteristics of the object under study

- Site Effect = Demographic Effects + Batch effects

---

### Batch effects are confounded by demographic effects

- Difficult to parse site effects into the components due to batch
- We want to <span style="color:red">mitigate batch effects</span> while .ye[preserving demographic effects]
- Approaches which properly isolate the batch effect while deconfound the demographic effect are lacking

---

### How do we address batch effects?

- Skip to correction (e.g., SVA, ComBat, etc.)?
- Focus on estimation with linear models?

Proposal: leverage techniques from .ye[causal inference] to yield strategies which are both theoretically and empirically sensible for batch effect analyses

### General Notation

| Symbol | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| $Y$ | random variable |
| $y$ | realization of random variable $Y$ |
| $f(y)$ | distribution of $Y$ evaluated at $y$ |
| $f(y\vert x)$ | distribution of $Y$ at $y$, conditional on $X$ at $x$ |

---
 
### Specific Notation

| Symbol | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| $Y$ | outcome measurement (measured) |
| $T$ | exposure (batch) |
| $X$ | covariates (measured) |
| $Z$ | covariates (unmeasured) |

<!-- - $f(y | t, x, z)$: the true outcome model, for any covariates $(x,z)$ -->
  <!-- - we .ye[cannot] estimate this without assumptions, due to unmeasured covariates $Z$ -->

---

### Causal Batch Effect

- $f_{x,z}(y|t)$: the true outcome, conditioned on the exposure, averaged over measured .ye[and] unmeasured covariates

$$\forall t \in [K]: \;\;\;\; f_{x,z}(y|t) = \int f(y|t,x,z) f(x,z) \;d(x,z)$$
- Causal Effects are .ye[functions] of the set $\\{f_{x,z}(y|t)\\}_t$
- Causal Batch Effect:

$$f\_{x,z}(y|t) \neq f\_{x,z}(y|t')$$

---

#### Causality is "easier" if we know everything .ye[impactful]


<img src="images/batch_effects/CoRRSimple.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:400px;"/>
- conditioning on measured/"observed" covariates sufficient to establish causality

---

### Causality and fear of the unknown(s)

<img src="images/batch_effects/CoRRProblem.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:400px;"/>

- assumptions (potentially .ye[completely unreasonable]) needed to proceed

---

### Typical neuroimaging covariates are much more complicated
<img src="images/batch_effects/CoRR_dag.png" STYLE="WIDTH:700px;"/>

---

### Confounding is the enemy

<img src="images/batch_effects/CoRR_soln.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:400px;"/>

- If we can address the confounding, we can obtain unbiased causal estimates
---

### Associational Effect

- Observe $\left(y_i, t_i\right)$ for all $i \in [n]$
- $f(y|t)$: distribution of outcome, conditional on batch

$$f(y|t) \neq f(y|t')$$
- estimated with $\texttt{dcorr}$


--

- Causal if measured and unmeasured covariates ($X$ and $Z$) are non-confounding
- If batches differ on demographics, for example, then not causal

---

### Conditional Effect

- Observe $\left(y_i, t_i, x_i\right)$ for all $i \in [n]$
- $f(y|t,x)$: distribution of outcome, conditional on batch and measured covariates

$$f(y|t,x) \neq f(y|t',x)$$
- estimated with conditional $\texttt{dcorr}$


--

Causal if .ye[strong ignorability] holds
1. Exposure $T$ independent of the outcome $Y$, conditional on covariates $X$ and $Z$
2. Covariate distributions overlap (propensity overlap)

---

### Adjusted Effect

- Observe $\left(y_i, t_i, x_i\right)$ for all $i \in [n]$
- Adjust samples such that the propensities are equal, yielding adjusted conditional distributions $\tilde f(y|t,x)$ 
<!-- and $\tilde f(y|t',x)$ -->
- Solves the issue of covariate overlap from the conditional effect

$$\tilde f(y|t,x) \neq \tilde f(y|t',x)$$
- estimated with .ye[matched] conditional $\texttt{dcorr}$

--

- Still requires exposure $T$ independent of the outcome $Y$, conditional on covariates $X$ and $Z$

---

### Causal Crossover Effect

- Observe $\left(y_i^{(t)}, t, x_i^{(t)}\right)$ for all $t \in [K], i \in [n]$
- $f\left(y^{(t)}\big|t,x^{(t)}\right)$: distribution of outcome at exposure $t$, conditional on exposure $t$ and covariates at $t$
$$f\left(y^{(t)}\big|t,x^{(t)}\right) \neq f\left(y^{(t')}\big|t',x^{(t')}\right)$$

- estimated with $\texttt{dcorr}$

--

- Traits/histories are constant to individuals, and therefore perfectly balanced across both groups
--

- States may be different, as they are functions of location & time
- Causal if no unmeasured confounding states

---


### Crossover design removes .ye[most] confounding

---

### Limitations of Existing Approaches for Site Effect Removal

- Existing techniques ignore the .ye[strong ignorability criterion], and therefore, do not provide valid causal estimands under reasonable assumptions
- ComBat, Conditional ComBat, Z-Scoring, etc. may remove demographic signal

<!-- :
1. Exposure $T$ independent of the outcome $Y$, conditional on covariates $X$ and $Z$
2. Covariate distributions overlap (propensity overlap) -->


---

### Causal ComBat

Given $K$ datasets:
--

1. Identify smallest dataset, $k'$, as the exposure

--
2. Match individuals from unexposed datasets $k\neq k'$ to the exposure individuals

--
3. Discard individuals from exposed dataset who do not have matches across all unexposed datasets

--
4. Discard individuals from unexposed datasets who are not matched to retained exposed individuals

--
5. Perform Conditional ComBat on retained exposed and unexposed individuals

--

Causal if exposure $T$ independent of the outcome $Y$, conditional on covariates $X$ and $Z$

### Causal effects only sometimes estimable (due to overlap)

.column[

]
.column[
- most datasets cannot even be run with matched partial dcorr
- we .ye[cannot determine] for most effects whether the effect is due to batch or demographic
]

---

### Does matching actually improve covariate overlap?

- The goal of the matching procedure for Causal DCorr/ComBat is to produce .ye[subsets] of datasets which are demographically .ye[similar]
- Does it actually do the job?
- How to quantify: "AUC" of two distributions

<img src="images/batch_effects/overlap.jpeg" STYLE="HEIGHT:300px;"/>

---

### Estimating covariate overlap

- let $\mathcal D$ represent the triplet of possible (continent, sex, age) pairings across the datasets
- $f(c,s,a|k)$ is the .ye[demographic distribution] for dataset $k$
- an estimate of the .ye[covariate overlap] between datasets $k$ and $l$ is:
$$\text{overlap}\_{k, l} = \int_{(c, s, a) \in \mathcal D} \min\left(\hat f(c, s, a | k), \hat f(c,s,a| l)\right)\text{d}(c,s,a)$$

<img src="images/batch_effects/after_matching.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:250px;"/>

---

### Does using causality actually give us a different answer?

- If we use Causal ComBat instead of Conditional ComBat, do we actually end up with different answers for statistical inference?
- for each edge of the connectome, investigate whether there is a sex effect (conditional on age) across individuals
- If leveraging causality is irrelevant, we would expect similar statistical inference for the chosen task

---

### Restricting to the American Clique

- Causal ComBat can only be performed on the American Clique, the matched subset of individuals with similar demographic variables from $5$ of the CoRR datasets
- If we subset the Conditional ComBat corrected connectomes to the same individuals, do we obtain the same answer?

| Raw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   | ComBat&nbsp;&nbsp; | Cond. ComBat | Causal ComBat |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
<img src="images/batch_effects/american_clique.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:160px;"/>
<img src="images/batch_effects/legend.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:160px;"/>

--

- Not quite... many more significant edges for Causal ComBat

---


### What if we don't subset at .ye[all]?

- Since we had to "throw away" data to use Causal ComBat, what if we hadn't thrown away data  at all?
- Note: Causal ComBat cannot be run on all of the data (due to lack of covariate overlap)

<img src="images/batch_effects/all_data_sigedge.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:160px;"/>
<img src="images/batch_effects/legend.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:160px;"/>

--

- There are more significant edges, but are they the .ye[same] significant edges?
---

### Causal ComBat produces disparate statistical inference

- for each batch effect removal strategy, identify the top $n$ edges (by effect size), and compare to the top $n$ edges produced by Causal ComBat
- DICE of $1$: top edges are in perfect agreement, DICE of $0$: edges have no overlap

<img src="images/batch_effects/dice_n.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:230px;"/>
<img src="images/batch_effects/dice_100.png" STYLE="HEIGHT:230px;"/>

---

### Causal ComBat produces disparate statistical inference

- Internal vs. external validity conflict

--

- "We exchange a (potentially) fake 10 dollar bill for a real 5 dollar bill"

### Contributions

1. Define batch effects as a problem in causal inference

--
2. Illustrate existing analyses of batch effects in neuroimaging amount to associational or conditional effects, and inadequately account for confounding

--
3. Show how batch effects can be estimated and tested on multivariate, non-euclidean batches using kernel methods

--
4. Provide an approach for batch effect correction that pays attention to confounding biases in the data

--
5. Showed that Causal ComBat produces different statistical inference from competing techniques, potentially drawing questions about statistical validity in neuroimaging
